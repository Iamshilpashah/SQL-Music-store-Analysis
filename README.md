# SQL-Music-store-Analysis
This repository contains SQL queries and analysis for a hypothetical music store database. The project focuses on exploring and analyzing a relational database schema used by an online music store. The analysis includes customer information, sales data, invoices, tracks, genres, and more.
The SQL queries in this repository are designed to answer various business and analytical questions related to the music store's performance. These queries are written to extract, aggregate, and filter data to generate valuable insights for decision-making. Some of the key analyses include:

1. Customer Insights: Identifying top customers, their purchase behavior, and genre preferences.

2. Sales Analysis: Analyzing sales trends based on different genres, tracks, and customers.

3. Invoice Analysis: Aggregating and summarizing invoice data to understand total sales and customer spending.

4. Genre Analysis: Analyzing which music genres are most popular among customers, particularly focusing on "Rock" genre listeners.

# Key Features
1. Relational Database Structure: The project uses tables such as customer, invoice, invoice_line, track, and genre to store music store data.

2. SQL Queries: A collection of SQL queries to extract insights, including filtering, joining multiple tables, and aggregating data using SUM(), COUNT(), and other SQL functions.

3. Real-World Scenarios: The queries are based on real-world scenarios in a music store, such as customer purchases, genre preferences, and invoice summaries.
